# SS-PAN
SS-PAN is a stacking learning framework to predict Î· for AN-based ceramics. In SS-PAN, a comprehensive array of physical features pertaining to both A-/B-site elements are extracted and then selected by using MDI methods combined with exhaustive search, then input into a two-layer stacking model for prediction.

# Usage
 Use Stacking.py to train the stacking model, then use Predict.py to output the final prediction on latent space. ExhaustiveSearch.py is provided for helping reader reproduce exhaustive search method.
